## Prediction of secretory signal peptide
<<<<<<< HEAD
> Signal peptides are short peptides typically located in the N-terminal section of the proteins. They carry information for protein secretions and are cleaved upon localization.
> In-silico prediction of signal peptides is crucial for functional annotation and localization.
