# Prediction of the secretory signal peptide
## Laboratory of Bioinformatics 2 2025/2026 -  Alma Mater Studiorum UniversitÃ  di Bologna

### Abstract
> Signal peptides are typically short peptides located in the N-terminal of proteins. They carry information for protein secretion and are cleaved upon localization.
> *In-silico* prediction of signal peptides is crucial for functional annotation and localization.

## Data Collection
**Objective:** retrieve relevant datasets from UniProtKB.

### Selection criteria

**For the positive dataset:**
  1. No fragments: `Fragment: No (fragment:false)`
  2. Select only eukaryotic proteins: `Taxonomy [OC]: 2759 (taxonomy_id:2759)`
  3. Filter-out sequences shorter than 40 residues: `Sequence length: 40 to (length:[40 TO *])`
  4. Filter-out unreviewed proteins: `Reviewed: Yes (reviewed:true)`
  5. Select on protein with experimental SP evidence: `Protein Existance[PE]: Evidence at protein level (existence:1)`
  6. Filter out proteins with SP shorter than 14 residues: `Signal Peptide: * Evidence: Experimental (ft_signal_exp:*)`

  Final query: `(existence:1) AND (length:[40 TO *]) AND (reviewed:true) AND (fragment:false) AND (taxonomy_id:2759) AND (ft_signal_exp:*)`

  Number of results (September 22nd): **2,949**

**For the negative dataset:**
  1. No fragments: `Fragment: No (fragment:false)`
  2. Filter-out unreviewed proteins: `Reviewed: Yes (reviewed:true)`
  3. Select on protein with experimental SP evidence: `Protein Existance[PE]: Evidence at protein level (existence:1)`
  4. Select only eukaryotic proteins: `Taxonomy [OC]: 2759 (taxonomy_id:2759)`
  5. Filter-out sequences shorter than 40 residues: `Sequence length: 40 to (length:[40 TO *])`
  6. Filter-out sequences having SP (any evidence): `Signal Peptide: * Evidence: Any (ft_signal_exp:*)`
  7. Select only proteins experimentally verified to be localized into cytosol, nucleus, mitochondrion, plastid, peroxisome or cell membrane: `Subcellular location term: SL-0173/SL-0191/SL-0173/SL-0204/SL-0209/SL-0039 Evidence: Experimental`

  Final query: `(existence:1) AND (length:[40 TO *]) AND (reviewed:true) AND (fragment:false) AND (taxonomy_id:2759) NOT (ft_signal:*) AND ((cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0091) OR (cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0191) OR (cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0173) OR (cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0204) OR (cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0209) OR (cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0039))`

  Number of results (September 22nd <\sup>): **20,615**
