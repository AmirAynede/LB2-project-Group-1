For data collection we did:
> obtain the API URL: {
"oc": "2759", "sequence length" : "40", "Reviewed": "yes", "fragments": "no", "PE": "evidence at protein level"
} 
RESULTS IN : {

            # Check if the coiled-coil starts before position 100
            if feature["location"]["end"]["value"] >= 14:

    return False

We were trying to filter positives which this function, which has some python syntax problems in the 3rd nested if. So, we realized it is best to use 2 separate APIs for the neg and pos datasets. The positive has to be filtered by Signal Peptide | * | Experimental.
